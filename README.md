Sym Train Simulation Intelligence Assistant 🤖

A. Project Overview

The Sym Train Simulation Intelligence Assistant is an automated customer support pipeline designed to analyze historical simulation transcripts and assist agents in resolving customer requests.

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Few-Shot Learning, the system:

Ingests raw simulation data (JSON transcripts & Images).

Categorizes customer intent (e.g., Insurance Claims, Payment Updates).

Generates a step-by-step resolution plan based on similar historical successful cases.

Note: This project is architected to run 100% locally using open-source HuggingFace models (Bart-Large), ensuring zero data egress and no API costs.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

The project relies on a robust stack of Machine Learning and Web frameworks:

Frontend: Streamlit (Interactive Web UI)

NLP Engine: HuggingFace Transformers

Models: * facebook/bart-large-mnli (Zero-Shot Classification)

facebook/bart-large-cnn (Abstractive Summarization)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Deep Learning Backend: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras

Full Dependency List

Ensure these are installed via requirements.txt:

streamlit

pandas

torch

transformers

tf-keras

tensorflow

scikit-learn


B. Installation & Setup

1. Prerequisite: Data Ingestion

The raw data provided by Sym Train is unstructured. You must run the data loader to clean, extract, and structure the data into a Knowledge Base.

Place your raw zip files into data/raw/.

Run the ETL script:

python src/data_loader.py


Result: A cleaned dataset will be created at data/processed/knowledge_base.csv.

2. Run the Intelligence App

Launch the web interface to interact with the AI assistant.

streamlit run app.py


The application will launch at http://localhost:8501.

First Run Note: The system will automatically download the necessary AI models (~3GB). This may take 1-3 minutes.

3. Run Model Analysis (Optional)

To generate the performance comparison report (Transformer vs GPT) for presentation slides:

python src/analysis.py

D. Evaluation Test Cases

The system is validated against the following scenarios:

Payment Update (Amex): "Hi, I ordered a shirt last week and paid with my American Express card..."

Payment Update (General): "Hi, I need to update the payment method for one of my recent orders..."

Insurance Claim (Accident): "Hi, I am Sam. I was in a car accident this morning..."

Insurance Claim (Short): "Hi, can you help me file a claim?"

Order Status (General): "Hi, I recently ordered a book online..."

Order Status (Delay): "Hi, I have been waiting for two weeks for the book I ordered..."
